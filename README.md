# Student Database Management System Using cpp(c++)
In this project we( me and my team) creates a Student Database Management System, allowing users to manage student information efficiently. Users can add, display, search, update, and delete student records. The system stores details like name, ID, marks, and contact information. Data is retrieved and modified using menus for ease of use. This project helps us to practice fundamental C++ concepts like classes, functions, file handling, and data structures while providing a practical application for managing student data.
